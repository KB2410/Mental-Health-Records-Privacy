#  Mental Health Records Module (Move on Aptos)

##  Description
The **Mental Health Records Module** is a Move smart contract designed to securely store and manage mental health records on the Aptos blockchain.  
Each user can create and update their own records, mark them as either **private** (owner-only) or **public** (visible to all), ensuring sensitive data protection with blockchain transparency and immutability.  

Key capabilities include:  
- Secure storage of records in byte format.  
- Access control that prevents unauthorized views based on privacy flags.  
- Direct storage and retrieval of records under a user’s own blockchain account.  



## � Vision
The long-term vision of this project is to provide individuals with **secure, decentralized, and self-sovereign control** over their mental health data.  
By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to:  
- Empower users to **own and control their personal health information**.  
- Promote **trustless interactions** between patients, doctors, or therapists.  
- Safeguard sensitive mental health data from misuse, tampering, or unauthorized access.  


## Future Scope
Upcoming improvements and extensions may include:  

1. **Shared Access Mechanism**  
   Allow users to grant controlled access permissions to healthcare providers, therapists, or family members.  

2. **Audit & Logging**  
   Emit events on record creation, modification, or access for better tracking and transparency.  

3. **Granular Access Control**  
   Provide more detailed permissions (e.g., read-only access, time-limited access).  

4. **Integration with Off-Chain Encryption**  
   Strengthen client-side encryption before uploading to chain, ensuring stronger privacy guarantees.  

5. **Cross-Platform Healthcare Integration**  
   Enable interoperability with external healthcare apps, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).
